# Meta AI Llama


## What is Meta Llama 3?

Meta Llama 3 is an open-source large language model developed by [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/). It is available on Cloudflare Workers AI and offers leading performance on a wide range of industry benchmarks, with a context window of 8k and a vocabulary of 128k tokens. Llama 3 has been fine-tuned with over 10 million human-annotated examples and is trained on a dataset of over 15 trillion tokens.

## Can Meta Llama 3 create Arduino sketches?

Yes, Meta Llama 3 can generate Arduino sketches. As a large language model, it can produce code in various programming languages, including C++ and Arduino sketches. You can provide a prompt or task description, and Llama 3 can generate a sketch to accomplish the task.
Here's an example prompt: "Generate an Arduino sketch to blink an LED connected to pin 13."
Keep in mind that the generated code may require adjustments and verification to work correctly, as the model is not perfect and may not always understand the specific requirements or constraints of a project.
If you have a specific project in mind, feel free to provide more details, and I can help you craft a prompt for Llama 3 to generate an Arduino sketch!

## What do you know about Arduino UNO R4 micro controller?

The Arduino UNO R4 is a 32-bit microprocessor that offers more speed, memory, connectors and connectivity options than any previous version of the board ¹. The UNO R4 microcontroller is based on the Renesas RA4M1 (Arm Cortex-M4) and has a 48 MHz clock speed, 32 KB of SRAM, 256 KB of flash memory and 8 KB of EEPROM ² ³. The UNO R4 also features a USB-C connector, a 12-bit DAC, CAN BUS, OP AMP, SWD port and support for battery-powered RTC ¹. Additionally, the UNO R4 has a built-in mechanism to detect operations that might cause the board to crash, such as division by zero, before they cause any trouble ¹.

## What is last date for Llama 3 training?

The Llama 3 model was released on April 18, 2024, and is available for use in English for commercial and research purposes. It was trained on a dataset of over 15 trillion tokens from public sources, and fine-tuned with over 10 million human-annotated examples. The model is intended for use in assistant-like chat and other natural language generation tasks.
